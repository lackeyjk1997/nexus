# NEXUS — Architecture Reference

## Overview
Nexus is a full-cycle AI sales orchestration platform where AEs direct AI agents across the buyer's journey. Built as a demo for Anthropic's sales leadership. Monorepo: Turborepo + pnpm, Next.js 14 (App Router, Turbopack), shadcn/ui + Tailwind, Supabase PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM, Claude API. Deployed on Vercel at `nexus-web-plum-iota.vercel.app`.

## Data Flows

### Observation Pipeline
Agent bar → POST `/api/observations` → Claude classifies (9 signal types) → entity extraction → fuzzy CRM matching → semantic cluster matching (confidence >= 0.6) → save observation → create/update cluster → route to support functions → if `process_innovation`: auto-create playbook idea

### Call Prep (8 Intelligence Layers)
Deal page "Prep Call" → POST `/api/agent/call-prep` → queries: (1) rep's agent config, (2) team intelligence by vertical, (3) system intelligence patterns, (4) win/loss patterns, (5) stakeholder alerts, (6) manager directives, (7) CRM context (deal, MEDDPICC, contacts, activities, transcripts), (8) playbook ideas (promoted + testing for this deal) → Claude API → structured brief

### Playbook Lifecycle
AE submits idea → proposed → manager approves (selects AEs, sets thresholds) → testing with A/B groups → measures velocity/sentiment/close rate with deal-level evidence → graduation when thresholds met → proven play injected into call prep as DIRECTIVE

### Demo Reset
POST `/api/demo/reset` → resets MedVista to Discovery → resets deal probabilities → deletes all playbook ideas and re-inserts 8 experiments with lifecycle data (evidence imported from `packages/db/src/seed-data/`) → deletes recent observations/queries/activities → marks notifications unread → recalculates cluster metrics

## Demo Data

### 10 Deals
MedVista (Sarah, 2.4M, Discovery), HealthFirst (Sarah, 3.2M, Closed Lost), TrustBank (Sarah, 950K, Tech Val), NordicMed (Ryan, 1.6M, Proposal), Atlas Capital (David, 580K, Negotiation), HealthBridge (Sarah, 1.2M, Closed Lost), MedTech Solutions (Ryan, 2.1M, Closed Won), NordicCare Patient Records (Ryan, 1.8M, Closed Lost), PharmaBridge (Sarah, 340K, Discovery), NordicCare API (Sarah, 780K, Tech Val)

### 8 Personas (in switcher)
Sales: Sarah Chen (AE), David Park (AE), Ryan Foster (AE) | Leadership: Marcus Thompson (MANAGER) | Solutions: Alex Kim (SA) | Support: Lisa Park (Enablement), Michael Torres (Product Marketing), Rachel Kim (Deal Desk)

### 8 Playbook Experiments
3 promoted (compliance-led discovery, CISO engagement, security doc pre-delivery), 3 testing (post-disco prototype, two-disco minimum, multi-threaded engagement), 1 proposed (competitive battlecard), 1 retired (ROI-first messaging)

### Tour
Removed in Session S10. Will be rebuilt later to tell the agent story.

## Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict, ES modules, functional components only
- Tailwind utility classes, shadcn/ui base components
- Drizzle ORM typed queries, no raw SQL (except seed scripts)
- camelCase vars/functions, PascalCase components/types, kebab-case files
- IDs: `uuid("id").defaultRandom().primaryKey()`
- Server components: `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`
- Model string: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Drizzle timestamps: pass Date objects, not strings
- SQL array containment: `memberId = ANY(testGroup)` not `@>`
- `scaling_scope` stored in attribution jsonb
- Proven plays prompt uses DIRECTIVE language in call prep
- `verticalSpecialization` is single enum, `outputPreferences.industryFocus` is jsonb array
- `initiatedBy` on fieldQueries has no FK (can be teamMembers or supportFunctionMembers)
- `systemIntelligence` confidence/relevanceScore: decimal(3,2) — values 0.00-9.99

## Known Issues
- MedVista resets to Discovery via demo reset; may need manual reset after testing
- `PgArray` errors from stale cache: fix with `rm -rf apps/web/.next && pnpm dev`
- No auth — persona switching via PersonaProvider context only
- Dev server default port 3001, auto-increments if occupied
- Influence scores and playbook "Start Test"/"Follow" buttons are UI-only in demo

## Deploy
```
pnpm dev                    # Dev server (Turbopack, port 3001)
git push origin main        # Vercel auto-deploys from main
```

Reset link: `?reset=true` query param on landing page

## Rivet Actors (Added Session S10)

Nexus uses Rivet (rivet.dev) for stateful AI agents. Documentation: https://rivet.dev/llms.txt

### Actor Architecture
- `apps/web/src/actors/` — Actor definitions and registry
- `/api/rivet/[...path]` — Rivet handler route
- Deal Agent: one per deal, accumulates intelligence over time
- React integration: `useActor()` hook from `@/lib/rivet` (no provider needed)

### Key Patterns
- Deal agents are created lazily via `getOrCreate([dealId])`
- Agent state persists across sessions (not lost on page refresh)
- Agents broadcast events via WebSocket to connected clients
- Agent memory is injected into call prep prompts as a 9th intelligence layer
- Supabase remains source of truth — agents are the intelligence/memory layer on top

### Environment Variables
- RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT — Rivet Cloud public endpoint
- RIVET_ENDPOINT — Rivet Cloud internal endpoint
